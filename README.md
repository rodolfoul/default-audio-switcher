## Default audio switcher
Serves the purpose for changing the default audio output, simply by invoking this application.

I developed this application, because I found myself repeatedly switching between windows default outputs, i.e. some times I would like to use my monitor's audio output (Maybe for youtube), other times I wanted to use my headset (Gaming, talking).

This project will quickly solve that problem, all you have to do is configure the jar to be called by a keymap on windows. In my case I'm using k95's g2.
